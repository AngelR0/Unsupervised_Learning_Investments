# Cryptocurrency Performance in Different Time Periods
---

##  Description:

This application will run clusters of cryptocurrency by their performance in different time periods (24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, 1 year). After figuring the best k-value for the K-Means formula by using the Elbow Method, we will plot the clusters and the line chart of the Elbow Method.
